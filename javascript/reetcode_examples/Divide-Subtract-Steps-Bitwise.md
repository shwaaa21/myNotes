# Code Principles Used
- **Bitwise Operations**: Using bitwise operators like `&` to check if a number is even or odd efficiently.
- **Conditional Logic**: Using `if` statements to decide between dividing or subtracting based on the number's parity.
- **Iteration and Counter**: Using a loop to repeatedly apply the operations and count the steps required to reduce the number to zero.

## Divide and Subtract Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero (Bitwise Approach)
### Problem Summary
Given an integer `num`, the task is to reduce it to zero by applying these steps:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, subtract 1.
Return the total number of steps required.

Using bitwise operations, we can optimize the even/odd check and simplify the logic for performing the steps.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
const numberOfSteps = function(num) {
    let steps = 0;

    while (num > 0) {
        // Check if the number is odd using bitwise AND
        if (num & 1) {
            num -= 1; // Subtract 1 for odd numbers
        } else {
            num >>= 1; // Right shift to divide even numbers by 2
        }
        steps++; // Increment step count
    }

    return steps;
};
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Initialize Steps**: Start with `steps = 0` to count the number of operations.
2. **Iterate Until Zero**: Use a `while` loop to repeatedly process `num` until it becomes zero.
3. **Bitwise Check for Odd Numbers**: Use `num & 1` to check if the number is odd:
   - If odd, subtract 1 (`num -= 1`).
   - If even, perform a right shift (`num >>= 1`), which is equivalent to dividing by 2.
4. **Increment Step Counter**: For each operation, increment the `steps` variable.
5. **Return the Result**: Once the loop exits, return the total number of steps.

This approach is efficient because it minimizes computational overhead by leveraging bitwise operations for parity checks and divisions.
